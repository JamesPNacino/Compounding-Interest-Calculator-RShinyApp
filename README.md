# Compounding-Interest-Calculator-RShinyApp
Select any stock or input your own interest rate and project the compounding returns from that investment.

## Summary

In this application, we will be analyzing one of the wonders of investings - compounding interest! There was no other compounding interest calculator I could find online which automatically calculates the average annual returns of a stock and applies compounding interst to those average returns. This application will let you do just that. I created this application using R Shiny and embedded the application into a website I created using html's iframe tag.
